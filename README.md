# Unicomer

## Overview

Welcome to  "Unicomer"! This project was created as part of the Techforb Challege, and I'm excited to share it with you. In this project, I aimed to recreate the project shown in the shared images, I decided to start with the desktop version since I got the models from a desktop view. At first glance, the project looked very authentic, so I decided not to use CSS frameworks and only the SCSS preprocessor. THAT HURT!

## Technologies Used

- Angular: Framework.
- Firestore: To create an API and to cosume it.
- RxJs: To read and bind the data from the API.

## How to Use

## Suggestions for Improvement

Here are a few areas where I believe This project could be improved:

- Mobile Design.
- The amount of data binded.
- Menu.
- Profile

- I'm sure there  is more oportunities for improvement that is why I'm always open to feedback

## About Me

!Leonel Pérez(/path/to/your/photo.png)

Hi, I'm Leo, the creator of this. I'm passionate about creating things, staff or to struggle a bit using Angular (joke), and I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project is was definetly a challege.

## Thoughts on the Project

I'm proud of what I've accomplished. It was a challenging experience that allowed me to work only using SCSS and I must say that I felt a bit rusty i have been working with too much frameworks and this was like a good oportunity to refresh all my knowledge. I look forward to further developing and refining this project.

## Thanks to Techforb

I would like to express my gratitude to TechForb for giving me the opportunity to participate in their challenge. This project has been a valuable learning experience.
